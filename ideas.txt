To be honest I haven't really thought of nothing as of now.

My SO suggested me to make a game about a ballerina as it was the first thing to come up on her mind bu I thought about billards but both of them are not really that endearing.

My interpretations of the theme would be making a game focussed on moviment but there are so very many of those because honestly most of the games that exist would fit so what is the point of having a theme that doesn't really limit us to anything?

I'm thinking about making a game about limited movement. I could warlock tower the hell out of this game... but I don't think that it would be great. I can think of some other limited movement stuff:

	> you're tied so your movement is really limited
	> some game where you have limited movement to complete a level (aka warlock's tower)
		> there is likely going to be 1090000 games like those
	> capital
