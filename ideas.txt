To be honest I haven't really thought of nothing as of now.

My SO suggested me to make a game about a ballerina as it was the first thing to come up on her mind bu I thought about billards but both of them are not really that endearing.

My interpretations of the theme would be making a game focussed on moviment but there are so very many of those because honestly most of the games that exist would fit so what is the point of having a theme that doesn't really limit us to anything?
